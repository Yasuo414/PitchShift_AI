# PitchShift AI
## Introduction
PitchShift AI is a small, practically insignificant utility that uses AI to raise or lower the pitch in recordings. 

## How to get started
We will need Python 3.9 or newer.
For clarity and to prevent chaos with Python environments, I recommend Anaconda3 or its lighter version, Miniconda3.
Both can be found at (https://www.anaconda.com/download/success)[https://www.anaconda.com/download/success]. Install them according to their guides.
```bash
# Then create a new Python 3.9 or higher environment using the command
conda create --name PitchShift_AI python=3.9 (or higher) --yes
# You may need to agree to their TOS. If prompted, accept them.
# After successfully creating the environment, activate it using
conda activate PitchShift_AI
```
